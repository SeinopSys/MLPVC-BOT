**1.** Everyone (including non-members) is welcome; you don't have to be an artist/musician/writer to be part of the conversation. However, if you *are* a club member, please tell us (along with your DeviantArt name) so we can assign you the approperiate role.

**2.** If your Discord username is different from your DeviantArt username we'll give you a nickname that matches your DA name. This is especially important if you're a member or someone who interacts with the group frequently. If you want to keep your Discord name visible, you can use the `/fixnick` command. To learn more, use `/help fixnick`.

**3.** We do not have any formal rules as of yet, but kindly try to keep topics in their respective chat rooms. Use your notification settings (Screenshot: <https://goo.gl/a7he2e>) to mute any channels you don't want to be notified of new messages in.
    #casual: This is the place for discussions of all kind, but strictly SFW. You can also share art, music, or funny pictures with the rest of the members
    #vectors: Request critique, suggestions or help with vectors - for all vector editing applications
    #support: Ask questions about the request/color guide site, the group, or the Discord server
    #spoilers: Here you can talk about upcoming or recently aired episodes and movies, as well as the comics
    #bot-sandbox: Here you can play around with the features of our very own bot, @me, without distrupting the conversation in other channels.
    #nsfw: This room is invite-only, and as the name suggests, it's for discussing adult material and sensitive topics. You can use the command `/nsfw join` to enter and `/nsfw leave` to leave
